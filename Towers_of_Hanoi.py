# The sort_tower function will accept three parameters from which peg the tower should be moved to.
# The starting tower with all the discs is (tower1), to a desitnation peg where it should move to (tower2), 
# and the remaining spare peg (tower3) which we can temporarily use to make this happen.
# Let's start with 3 discs
def move_to_tower(disc_height, tower1, tower2, tower3):
	if disc_height == 0

	# move disc from tower1 to tower2
	


# create a move_disc function
