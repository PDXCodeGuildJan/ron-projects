<h2>How to shoot pet portraits with off-camera flash.</h1>


<p>
	In this tutorial we'll show you a simple way to set up an off-camera flashgun to shoot more dynamic pet portraits. We'll also explain how to set up a quick home studio for your pet picture, as well as some easy posing tips.

<p>
If you have a furry four-legged friend that you absolutely adore, chances are you spend a lot of time taking photos of them. Shooting outdoors is relatively simple, as you'll have plenty of natural light, making it easier to get sharp shots of your pet when it's moving.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to indoor shots, however, you face a number of challenges. The first is light – it's likely that you won't have enough of it to capture pin-sharp shots handheld.
</p>
<p>
And, just as with portraits of people, the front-on light from your DSLR's pop-up flash or a flashgun mounted on your camera's hotshoe can be too harsh; it can cause 'pet-eye', the animal equivalent of red-eye (it's usually greenish in colour), and may even frighten your subject.
</p>
<p>
Another challenge is that your subject probably won't want to sit still for long; capturing engaging expressions can prove tricky too, as often it'll happen so quickly that you'll miss the shot. Finding a clutter-free backdrop for your shoot can also be difficult.
</p>
<p>
So in this project we'll show you how to set up a simple DIY studio, and show you some easy off-camera flash techniques that will enable you to use a fast shutter speed to capture fleeting movements or expressions.
</p>
<p>
By positioning the flash to one side and using a reflector to bounce light back into the shadows you can produce more even lighting – and capture more flattering shots of your precious pooch!

<h3>1) Setting up your pet portrait</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>01 Set up the backdrop</b>
For the best results you'll want a plain, clutter-free backdrop that contrasts with your subject. We arranged an old white bed sheet, both as a backdrop and for our subject to sit on; later on we hung up a piece of coloured material to create a different look.</li>


<li><b>02 Shutter speed and aperture</b>
Select Manual mode and set a shutter speed no faster than your camera's top sync speed, which is normally 1/200 or 1/250 sec. To ensure that both of your pet's eyes and nose are in focus, set a medium aperture, such as f/8, for a good depth of field.</li>


<li><b>03 Wireless flash control</b>
Go to Flash Control settings in the first shooting menu. Ensure flash firing is enabled, select Built-in Flash Func and set Flash Mode to Manual. Scroll down to Wireless Func and select the first option, so that only the external flashgun will affect the exposure.</li>


<li><b>04 Flash settings</b>
Select Flash Output to set the external flash power; your camera's pop-up flash will fire a pre-flash to trigger the flashgun. Set your flashgun to Slave mode and ensure it's set to the same channel as your DSLR; you'll see this in the Built-in Flash Func menu settings.</li>


<li><b>05 Set up the flashgun</b>
Open your pop-up flash, then adjust the flashgun so the head is pointing towards the subject and the sensor is pointing towards your camera.</li>


<li><b>06 Keep your subject happy!</b>
Photographing dogs poses similar challenges to photographing children. They have a short attention span, so it's best to work in short bursts. You'll get more engaging shots if they're happy and relaxed, so don't be too firm with your commands!</li>
